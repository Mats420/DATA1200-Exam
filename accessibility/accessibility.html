    <h3>Homepage:</h3>
    <p style="width: 700px;">
        The homepage directs the user to the other content of the website.
        This was done with a sidebar, some catchphrases that are clickable, 
        and a welcoming background image that is used on the other subpages as well.
    </p>
    <p style="width:700px;">
        The sidebar used would be reused on the other subpages as well, but with different width when open and different links inside.
        This goes for the navBar too, where the Mountlake logo and navbar height is reused on all pages except for the topic page and accessibility one. 
        Upon minimizing the page, all relevant info is still available to the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Restaurant and About us:</h3>
    <p style="width:700px;">
        Instead of having a scrolling function on fullscreen, we decided to have arrows navigating between pages.
        If the screen is minimized however, the scrolling would be available. Moreover, all relevant info is still available to the user. On the navbar,
        there are options to navigate to the pages by clicking "menu", "preview" or "about & contact".
    </p>   
    <p style="width:700px;">   
        On the second page under "preview menu" we used flip-boxes such that on hover, the meals would rotate in a manner where the flipside desscribes the meal. 
        The last page contains the same info as the flip-boxes which is the "menu."
        About us & contact contains contact info and opening times, this is all still visible when minimizing the page. 
        No major issues were found via WAVE or W3, only warnings about headings and links being empty.
    </p>
    <h3>Booking:</h3>
    <p style="width:700px;">
        The booking page is similar to the about us page in the sense that all text is gathered in their "bubbles".
        This page contains a google map which is implemented via an iframe tag which is supported and provided by google maps. 
    </p>
    <p style="width:700px;">
        On the page, a form is able to be filled with info that a restaurant would find relevant.
        On the automated test in W3, there is a complaint about the id "form" being used too many times.
        We decided against resolving this, since the form should only appear real and not function as such, 
        and the tag helped styling the content in an appropriate manner.
    </p>
    <p style="width:700px;">
        Upon minimizing the page, all relevant info is still dispayed.
    </p>
    <h3>Topic:</h3>
    <p style="width:700px;">
        For the topics page we copied and pasted one of our submissions in DATA1100. 
        Here we decided to add two seperate slideshows, that the user can interact with whilst reading the text.
        Certain words are linked to sources and upon hovering over them, a short description should be available. 
        On the footer, all images and sources used are listed and linked.
        No major issues found via WAVE or W3.
    </p>
